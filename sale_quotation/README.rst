=============================
Sale Quotation
=============================

Sales quotation process is an important part of the
sales process and being able to number all sales quotations and keep
track of them is essential to the business:
Successive new sales quotations should be stored in OpenERP.
Related sales quotations should be linked together so that we can trace
the history with the customer and final sales order.
A sales order created from a sales quotation should be linked to the last
sales quotation.
Sales Quotations and Sales Order should have different numbering sequences.
When a sales order is to be set as draft and revalidated (for example to
recreate the stock pickings), original Sales Order number should be kept.
Sales Quotation status should allow to identify in which states is a
quotation (lost and converted).
